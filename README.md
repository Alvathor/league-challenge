### What was done
- [x] Removed all pods
- [x] Removed Main.storybord
- [x] Swift version changed to 5.2
- [x] Target changed to 15.2

### Stack used
- MVVM architecture
- Dependency Injection
- SPM
- SwiftUI
- Combine
- XCTests

### What would I do if I had more time
- Create a search field
- Support/Test layout on all possible devices

### What was my approach and why
In this challenge I used SwiftUI since I'm currently working 100% on my projects, so naturally would be more comfortable with that. Regarding libs, I believe it wasn't necessary to use the libraries within the project, as all elements, services and extensions were simple and fast to implement, except Image Cache I used a different lib using SPM.

### How many time 
I spent a little over `4 hours` to complete the requirements, and less than `1 hour` to finish all unit tests.

### Observations
- Since I didn't have enough information from API documentation, I couldn't build the pagination
